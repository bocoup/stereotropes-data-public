    "plot": "They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7 a.m., they had nothing to say, but by 4 p.m., they had bared their souls to each other and become good friends. To the outside world they were simply a Brain, an Athlete, a Basket Case, a Princess, and a Criminal, but to each other, they would always be the Breakfast Club.",

The scene with Bender and Vernon is debatable: Vernon wanted to be able to claim Bender had assaulted him, and Bender knew it. Hell, Vernon had literally just pointed out that no one would take Bender's word over his; his plan was obvious.
