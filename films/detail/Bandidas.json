    "plot": "In 1848, a New York bank wants to put a railroad across Mexico, so it buys up small banks around Santa Rita, Durango, and evicts farmers on the proposed rail line who owe money. The bank's henchman is the murderous Jackson. He runs afoul of two women, Mar\u00eda, the tough but uneducated daughter of a farmer, and Sara, the European-educated daughter of the owner of one of these banks. To feed the now landless people and to seek revenge, Mar\u00eda and Sara become bank robbers, veritable Robin Hoods. But Jackson and his hired guns are after them. What are the women's options?",
