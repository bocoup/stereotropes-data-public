    "plot": "This video is mostly taken up by talking about vengeance rather than getting on with the job. A mean trashy exploitation picture about three convicts who escape from jail and hole up at the house of a black minister. There's a few nasty scene's where the ministers family are being repeatedly terrorised by the thugs. In the end the minister turns the tables on the 3 convicts and gives them their just desserts.",
