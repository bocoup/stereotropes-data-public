    "plot": "Anna, a fearless optimist, sets off on an epic journey - teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff and his loyal reindeer Sven - to find her sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.",

The wimpiness of Anna in fanfiction is usually proportional to the strength of Elsa; the more resilient Elsa is in any particular fic, the more chickified Anna becomes. Generally, Anna's sudden chickification is explained by the shock of having her sister back, and the years of loneliness she endured during the film's prologue.\n Elsa herself can also qualify; although she is far more emotionally vulnerable then Anna and breaks down several times during the film, her tendencies tend to be exaggerated in fanfic, making her a wreck incapable of human contact as a result of isolation (despite it being her who first reached out to Anna at the party in the film) and constantly suffering nightmarish flashbacks to the events of the film and its climax.",

Actually, only some of the princess characters got in; those that had bit parts, were from unpopular movies, or just weren't as merchandisable were shoved in the back. And they've tried a few times to add non-royals into the line, despite Mulan, Esmeralda, and Alice definitely not being princesses, either to ease concerns that the classic pantheon wasn't dynamic and/or integrated enough (Mulan being the best Action Girl they could use, since they didn't have one) or to fill out various storybooks, music albums, etc. Pocahontas, another honorary member of the group, actually is, but might not have been considered \"classic\" when the line was introduced. (That, or her clothes aren't considered pretty enough.) Naturally, this was somewhat referenced in Kingdom Hearts, where those who qualified as \"Princesses of Heart\" just happened to be popular characters on both sides of the Pacific. Alice, a non-princess, was in fact added to the list, with the thin justification that she becomes a queen in the original books (and as foreshadowing that another seemingly normal character is also one). Ariel was in fact REMOVED from the list for Kingdom Hearts, probably because, as a mermaid, she wouldn't be able to leave Atlantica to interact with the larger plot, but she gets to be an Action Girl Guest Star Party Member.\n Other commonly forgotten Disney princesses (or queens) include Eilonwy, Tiger Lily, Kidagakash, Maid Marian (mentioned in the film to be King Richard's niece), and Nala (by marriage to Simba). If you stretch, you can also include Jane (queen of the jungle), Alice (who becomes a queen in the chess sense in Through the Looking Glass), Megara (who originally was a daughter of King Chreon), and Kida (daughter of the king for almost 10,000 years, and becomes queen in the end).\n Ironically, the Powers That Be at Disney have been downplaying the princess element of its films after theorizing that marketing The Princess and the Frog as a Princess movie turned away the male demographic. This is mainly limited to the films' marketing and not their actual content, however: Tangled upgrades Rapunzel from a commoner into a princess by birth, Wreck-It Ralph turns out to have an unexpected princess in Vanellope, although she decides that she'd rather be president, and Frozen gives a fairy tale that originally didn't have a single princess in it two princess characters (although one of them is technically a queen).",
