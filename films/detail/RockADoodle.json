    "plot": "Edmund is a boy whose favorite story of Chanticleer, a rooster whose singing makes the sun rise every morning until the Grand Duke of Owls, whose kind despises the bright sun, makes him look like a fraud. With Chanticleer driven from his farm, the owls put it under a spell of perpetual darkness and rain. As Edmund's own farm floods, he calls to Chanticleer, only to summon the Duke himself who transforms him into a kitten to devour him. Rescued by Chanticleer's former friends Patou the hound, Snipes the magpie and Peepers the mouse, they go on an adventure to the city where the rooster had gone and became a great singing rock star!",
