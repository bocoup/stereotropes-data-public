    "plot": "Produced by Scott Miller and Company with years of research and featuring heart-rending interviews, as reported by Andrea Reed of Toronto's M.U.C.K. Film Festival, A SOLDIERS STORY focus on the depths of the human anthrax vaccine controversy. It examines the harm done to Allied Gulf War troops, when the governments of the U.S., Britain, Canada, and Australia first ordered their soldiers to take the anthrax vaccine, because the U.S. military had approved the sale of virulent anthrax bacteria to Iraq in the 1980s. A SOLDIERS STORY shows that it is unlikely for these vaccines, as designed, to prevent inhalation anthrax disease, without first causing harm through the onset of cancers and auto-immune diseases,",
