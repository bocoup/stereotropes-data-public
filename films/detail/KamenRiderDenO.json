When one of her regulars asked how she could be so calm, she muttered \"That's right\", then went off...to make \"Ryo-chan\" some special hostage snacks. Cue mass Face Fault.

She's known from the start that \"Ryo-chan\" was Den-O, and that his friend Yuuto is the time-displaced teenage version of her fianc\u00e9e.",
