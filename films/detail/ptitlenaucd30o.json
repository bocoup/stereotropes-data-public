                "role": "Faux Action Girl: The film provides us with a very ridiculous example of this trope with Princess Katie. In the training sequence she is shown to be an excellent swordswoman, archer and horse rider, thus she should be \"of course, able to take care of herself\". Except, then she gets kidnapped by some mooks, in broad daylight and needs to be rescued by Calvin and King Arthur. A fight begins. Now on the good guys' side we have Arthur (a very old man), Calvin (a nerd who fails at baseball and has only trained swordfighting for a couple of days) and Katie (who is young, fast and has trained swordfighting all her life). Arthur and Calvin fight and kill the mooks while Katie, who really should be \"...able to take care of herself\" gets kidnapped again. The same film also subverts the trope, however, with Katie's older sister Princess Sarah. The viewer spends the entire movie believing that tomboyish Katie is the tough one of the pair, only to find out that  Sarah is the secret identity of the Black Knight, who has been fighting the enemy all along.",
