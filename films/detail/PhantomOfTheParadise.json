    "plot": "Rock opera version of The Phantom of the Opera which also serves as a dark satire of the music business. Notorious record tycoon Swan has sold his soul to the devil for eternal youth and success - 20 years ago. Swan's current scheme is to steal the music from meek composer Winslow Leach to celebrate the opening of his rock palace, The Paradise. While trying to stop Swan, Leach becomes the victim of a freak accident that leaves him horribly disfigured. He takes refuge in the cavernous Paradise, hiding his mangled face beneath an eerie mask and planning gruesome vengeance upon Swan - and everyone else who has hurt him.",
