However, in the first episode of the series Stargate SG-1, she gets captured as a host for the Big Bad aliens, setting Daniel's motivation as finding a way to rescue her. But over the course of the series he attracts flocks of alien babes, and in the midst of not refusing their attentions he never seems to remember his wedding vows. To make it worse, when the writers finally remember that he has a wife waiting for him, they spend one whole episode detailing how he finds her and she dies. Now that his motivation is gone, does Daniel quit the team? For about five minutes.\n She was not an alien. She was a human descended from a group of proto-Egyptians kidnapped thousands of years ago to serve as slaves for Ra. Also, who in their right mind would want to give up an amazing career studying living offshoots of ancient cultures on other planets to go back to a job where EVERY SINGLE PERSON in academia thinks the character is a two-bit hack?",
