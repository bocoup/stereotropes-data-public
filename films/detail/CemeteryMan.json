    "plot": "This movie is based on a novel of Tiziano Sclavi, and it always reflects the \"sclavian philosophy\" diffused by the most succesful comics in Italy: Dylan Dog, the detective of the nightmare.

He is the guardian of the cemetery of Buffalora, a little town in the north of Italy, in which, we don't know why, corpses rise from tombs and Dellamorte has to destroy them. Dellamorte seems not to ask to himself why this happen, he shoots and loves. But at the end he wants to leave Buffalora...",
