They seem never to have bothered to research this; the books, and Middle-earth in general, have always had an extremely strong female readership for many reasons. From about 1969 to 1971, there was a movement among fans of Leonard Nimoy to cast him as Aragorn in a live-action film version (this is long before Bakshi).
