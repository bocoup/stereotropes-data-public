Ana is a combination of the sweet one/smart girl due to her quiet nature and love for mathematics. Claudia is the sexy one because she \"gets around\" the most and is considered the school's residential beauty. Though, this trope is averted when viewers learn Claudia is more than just a face. Lupe is Team Mom because she takes care of her younger siblings while her parents are at work. Rafaela is considered the mannish one because she is shown to hang around Tito the majority of the movie and dress in masculine attire (i.e. over-sized boy shirts and pants).",
