    "plot": "Bison, the ruthless leader of the international terrorist organization Shadowlaw, has been desperately searching for the greatest fighter on the planet for years. He finds it in Ryu, a young wanderer who never stays in one place long enough for Bison to find him. He does, however, get a fix on Ken Masters, an American martial arts champion who studied with Ryu as a child under the same master. Meanwhile, Major Guile of the United States Army is forced to team up with Chun Li from China in hopes of apprehending Bison and putting a stop his international ring of crime.",

In the movie, he seemingly becomes jealous when he notices Bison staring at Chun-Li's breasts, while watching a video feed of her and Guile. Bison notices his reaction and gives him the order to eliminate her, which Vega gladly accepts. During the fight, he takes his time torturing her until she fights back and and steps on his face. At this point, Vega loses his sh*t and drops all pretense of toying with her.",
