    "plot": "Aspiring actress Eve Harrington maneuvers her way into the lives of Broadway star Margo Channing, playwright Lloyd Richards and director Bill Sampson. This classic story of ambition and betrayal has become part of American folklore. Bette Davis claims to have based her character on the persona of film actress Talullah Bankhead. Davis' line \"Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night\" is legendary, but, in fact, all of the film's dialog sparkles with equal brilliance.",
