    "plot": "Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. At first he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking. That all changes, however, when he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.",

And he didn't care for any of the women he was with, stating they'll get over him and the heartbreak. Ann was the closest to loving a woman he ever came, but he still wasn't willing to change for her and settle. He later falls for Glinda, possibly only because he reminds her of Ann, but he can have her without compromising his wanton hero/show-off status.",
