Malibu borders the Valley, or is otherwise close enough to it (much more so than Hollywood proper, though the city of North Hollywood is actually within the Valley) for Julie, Stacey, and Suzi to not mind that Loryn was not a true Valley Girl. Considering that Malibu was, and still is, one of the beach spots in southern California, befriending Loryn apparently came with a few perks.",
