    "plot": "In this 6-story anthology collection, Batman faces new villains and old ones in a time-line after Batman Begins. In \"Have I Got A Story For You\", 3 kids tell wildly different stories about Batman during a fight through Gotham. \"Crossfire\" focuses on two policemen who end up getting in the middle of a crime battle. \"Field Test\" has Lucius Fox creating a new technology for Batman, but is it too powerful? \"In Darkness Dwells\" features Killer Croc and Scarecrow, who have kidnapped a priest. \"Working Through Pain\" goes through flashbacks of Bruce Wayne's training while Batman finds his way through the sewers. Finally, \"Deadshot\" focuses on the titular sniper, who has a new target in Gotham.",

This is in spite of the fact that in real life India women who make it as female warriors are highly respected and have led entire armies as far back the twelfth century.",
