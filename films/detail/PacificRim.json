    "plot": "When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.",

And despite being one of the best Jaeger pilots with the highest Kaiju kill count in history at only 21, Chuck is also shown to have a Hair-Trigger Temper, terrible communication skills, and a double dose of Daddy Issues and Survivors Guilt with regards to his father choosing to save him over his mother. He later pulls a Heroic Sacrifice and blows up Striker Eureka to take down two Kaiju so Gipsy Danger can seal the Breach.\n It's very likely that several other Jaeger pilots were reared from adolescence to fight the Kaiju as well. Sadly, if there were any other teenage or young pilots during the Golden Age of the Jaegers, they were almost certainly killed prior to the film in Kaiju battles.",
