One ferry is carrying prisoners, the other is filled with civilians. The captains of the ferries have the detonators\u2014to each other's boat. If one boat blows up the other, then it will go free. If neither boat destroys the other, they'll both be blown up in a few minutes. The captain of the prisoner's ferry is struggling with the decision, when a very large, very scary black man (played by Tiny Lister) in prisoner's orange and chains comes over to him. He states that the captain knows what he needs to do, but doesn't have the guts for it \u2014 but he does. He convinces the captain to hand him the detonator, then immediately throws it out the window and into the water, having said they should've done that ten minutes ago.\n Played straight by Gambol, the black gangster, at least until Joker crashes his party.\n Played straight in the '89 film.
