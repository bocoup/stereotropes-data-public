    "plot": "At a convent, fragile, unearthly Sister Agnes gives birth (she says it's a virgin birth), but the child dies. The police soon are involved because of the death of the baby. However, the main conflict is between Mother Superior Miriam Ruth, who wants Agnes left alone, and Dr. Martha Livingston, a psychiatrist determined to help Agnes gain a stronger grasp on reality and uncover any wrongdoers.",
