Sure, vanity might explain part of it, but to go so far as to seek the death of a rival (who is not even aware of her grudge), and undergo a painful transformation to disguise herself so that she could personally carry out a murder plot? Seems a bit over the top, but then again, that's the warping nature of evil for you.\n In an anime adaptation, she wants to steal Snow White's body instead. And it's revealed that she's not actually the Queen, but stole her body instead when she was a child. She (or even 'it') may have spent generations Body Surfing from beauty queen to beauty queen...\n In some of the earliest versions of the tale, the Wicked Queen fears Snow White's maturing beauty because it symbolizes her impending death due to an ancient mythological trope that a person's child is his or her replacement \u2014 and she is Snow White's biological mother (not step-mother). So her efforts to kill Snow White are not based on physical vanity, but on a desperate hunger for immortality.\n In Snow White & the Huntsman, Wicked Queen Ravenna is using magic to maintain her youth and beauty, and taking Snow White's heart will allow her to live as a beauty forever. It's never really explained why.",
