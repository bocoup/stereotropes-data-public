    "plot": "In the far future, man has destroyed the Earth in the \"Seven Days of Fire\". Now, there are small pockets of humanity that survive. One pocket is the Valley of Wind where a princess named Nausica\u00e4 tries to understand, rather than destroy the Toxic Jungle. Note that the old US release titled Warriors of the Wind is an entirely kiddiefied version which edits the original movie heavily, thus creating an entirely different story. -Andre",
