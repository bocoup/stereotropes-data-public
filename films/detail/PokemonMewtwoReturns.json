The search leads them to the hidden plateau where Mewtwo has established a haven for the cloned Pok\u00e9mon from the previous film. The evil Giovanni is plotting to recapture Mewtwo and renew his efforts to create an army of bio-engineered Pok\u00e9mon. Aided by the reluctant Meowth, Ash and his friends defeat Giovanni and his henchman.",

She also successfully fools the main cast into thinking she's one of the good guys by acting like a traditional dumb blonde when her real personality is exactly the opposite.\n Perhaps more badass than that is that Domino gets away with talking to Giovanni any way she damn well pleases, including telling him that he's crossed the line and lost all sense of Pragmatic Villainy.\n All of the female 'Dex Holders in Pok\u00e9mon Special qualify as this. Of note is Yellow, who everyone underestimates until she  gets pissed off and completely crushes the competition.\n The Anime has at least two in Ash's Bayleef and Snivy. Best Wishes character Iris is this too...but not for the same reasons as in Pok\u00e9mon White.\n Phantom Thief Pok\u00e9mon 7 has Lily who is, or was, one of the best grunts Team Galactic has to offer (and in this continuity they're quite the fearsome bunch), but can't be older than fifteen at best.",
