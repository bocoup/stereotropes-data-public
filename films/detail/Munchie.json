    "plot": "In this in-name-only sequel to Munchies (1987), a new kid in town, Gage Dobson, can't find his place in the new environment despite having such a cool name. The kids at school bully him, the girl he likes doesn't register him and his mom is about to marry a scoundrel. Everything changes for Gage Dobson when he stumbles into Munchie, a friendly gremlin-like creature that dresses like a lounge singer, sounds like a stand-up comedian and has magic powers. They become friends and Munchie decides to help the kid with all these problems. Gage Dobson is about to get even! If only there wasn't a mad scientist who wants to use Munchie for experiments to learn how the creature ticks.",
