Luke Shapiro has just graduated from high school, sells marijuana, and trades pot for therapy from a psychologist, Dr. Jeffrey Squires. Luke is attracted to a classmate, Stephanie, who's out of his league and Squires' step-daughter.

It looks as if Squarez is rearing to rip Luke a new one when he finds out that he and his stepdaughter Stephanie are dating; however, it's actually Luke that he's worried about, warning him that Stephanie is likely to dump him once her friends return from vacation. Considering the fact that he's Luke's friend, therapist, and that Luke hinted at considering suicide, it's not as strange as it seems.",
