These were later transformed into a best-selling book and the movie follows the book closely. It describes the meeting of Kyun-woo (Cha) and an unnamed girl.

Once he helps her, Kyun-woo develops a deep sense of responsibility for her which enables him to tolerate (somehow) the girl's abuses.",

However, she definitely has issues and motivations unrelated to her man, and it turns out that she's been using him as a substitute for her dead fianc\u00e9, who was the protagonist's cousin. Things end up working out, though.",
