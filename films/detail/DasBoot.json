With better escorts of the Destroyer Class, however, German U-Boats have begun to take heavy losses. \"Das Boot\" is the story of one such U-Boat crew, with the film examining how these submariners maintained their professionalism as soldiers and attempted to accomplish impossible missions, all the while attempting to understand and obey the ideology of the government under which they served.",
