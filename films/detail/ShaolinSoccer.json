Eventually she goes through a second transformation where she gives up on the makeup, etc., and shaves her head bald \u2014 and looks better than ever (one wonders what happened to the bad skin).\n This is rather common in Stephen Chow movies, in that almost all of his love interests have either physical flaws, or are characteristically flawed. One of the most memorable moments in Chow's movies before he became vastly famous was the ending scene of God of Cookery, where the comically homely female street chef got an extreme makeover after he alleged death. The actress playing the role, however, is a famous Chinese pop star in real life, so her final appearance in the movie actually had her to do away with her faux ugly makeup.",
