Making it also a straight example of a whole different trope, Designated Girl Fight.\n Played with in the first part, where Thorne's moll sits out a fight between Harvey Dent (Pre-Two-Face) and Batman vs. Thorne's men, not because she was scared or ineffectual, she was just enjoying the show, describing it as \"Wild!\", disturbingly excitedly.\n Joker and Harley both avert and play this one straight. Often Joker will tell Harley to sit out and let him handle \"Batsy\" on his own, in which case she will merrily cheer him on, as if she was watching a TV show. Other times she will help in the fight, often bringing out bigger and badder weapons than the Joker himself (although Joker tends to stay more of the threat since he's a better fighter than she is).\n In the comics, however, Harley is a much better and stronger fighter than Joker (after getting low level superstrength and agility from one of Poison Ivy's chemicals), although Joker usually carries more lethal weaponry. Regardless, he most often uses her as his strong arm while he stays behind, not bothering to fight unless he is facing Batman himself.\n A hilarious inversion comes in the Batman/Superman crossover World's Finest, where Harley and Mercy, Luthor's assistant, take an instant dislike to one another, and have an all out brawl in the background while Joker and Lex talk business.\n Played straight for Talia Al Ghul, daughter of the infamous Ra's Al Ghul and on-again-off-again Love Interest for Batman. Whenever her daddy and her beau fight, she refuses to take a side. The best she'll do is prevent Batman from actually capturing and imprisoning Ra's after winning said fight.\n Probably justified, as they are her father and the man she professes to love, which would make choosing a side somewhat awkward.",
