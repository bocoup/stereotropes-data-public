However, during a family crisis, he is suddenly left in charge of his nephew and nieces. Unaccustomed to suburban life, fun-loving Uncle Buck soon charms his younger relatives Miles and Maizy with his hefty cooking and his new way of doing the laundry.

With a little bit of luck and a lot of love, Uncle Buck manages to surprise everyone in this heartwarming family comedy.",
