    "plot": "Based on a DC Comics hero created by Robert Kanigher and Ross Andru in 1962, \"Metal\" revolves around a brilliant scientist, William Magnus, and his creations: six highly advanced robots who have powers associated with their respective metals -- gold, iron, lead, tin, mercury and platinum. Instead of having to be programed, the Metal Men can think for themselves, which is both their genius and their biggest flaw.",
