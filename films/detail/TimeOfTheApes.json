    "plot": "Time of the Apes is a strung-together movie made from several episodes of a Japanese TV show. Big-hipped Catherine and her two charges, Johnny (who \"doesn't care\") and Caroline, are sent to some alternate time-line by being frozen in cryogenic tubes during an earthquake. They end up on a planet where apes rule humans but are ruled themselves by a supercomputer named \"UECOM\", which is a malevolent artificial being created by humans.",
