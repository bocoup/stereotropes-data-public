    "plot": "New York City, Dr. Richard Jacks is a creator of perfumes. He spends all of his days try to invent the next best thing in the industry. His girlfriend, Sarah, sometimes gets pushed to the side, but he loves her. One day, he discovers that his great-grandfather,Dr. Jekyll, was a scientist with a secret: a revolutionary discovery. Richard tries to follow in footsteps of his Dr. Jekyll and creates perfumes, each greater than the next. But one gives him more than he bargained for. Richard is transformed into the buxom bombshell, Helen Hyde. Helen is a powerhouse and a woman with a plan. The catch is, Richard doesn't know she exists. As he finds himself in situations that are more ridiculous than the last, Richard becomes aware of his alter ego and makes a plan to get rid of her once and for all. But, Helen's career is growing, she won't go without a fight.",
