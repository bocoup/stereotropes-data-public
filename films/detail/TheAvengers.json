He's less uppercrust and more the ideal American Boy Next Door type; however, he makes up for that with his keen intelligence and artistic talent. He's unfailingly polite to every woman he meets - he shields Black Widow instead of himself or Hawkeye during battle, and he pretty much gets lip-raped by a random secretary because he can't figure out how to turn down her advances without being rude. He will do anything to help a friend, even go on what basically amounts to a suicide mission, alone. The only time we see him drinking heavily is when said friend dies later on - and even then, his hyperactive metabolism won't let him get drunk. He plays The Spock to Iron Man's The McCoy (and challenges Iron Man to a one-on-one fistfight, not over a woman, but because Tony's being the consummate douchebag we all know and love). And the only time we hear him swear is when he's vehemently ordering his love interest (who outranks him) to get the hell outta Dodge before she's shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. Damn.",
