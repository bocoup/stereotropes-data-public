    "plot": "A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war is being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possesses it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain's ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky's grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain's glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all \"specimens of this alien race.\" Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, deep inside Hoover Dam, the cryogenically stored body of Megatron awakens.",

Naturally, he hates Starscream, and will use his Punch of Kill Everything to pound you into the dirt for even the slightest hint of disrespect or treason.\n Lugnut has two driving forces in his programming: The compulsion to serve the grand and glorious Megatron, and the utter destruction of Autobots (in the name of his glorious master).\n The Transformers Prime version of Soundwave is also this.

He's also the team's medic, making comparisons to Bones McCoy even more impossible.\n Also Ultra Magnus, especially [when he's got his hammer with him.\n Kup in Transformers Generation 1 is definitely a cool old guy, like Animated Ratchet but much less grumpy. Also, in \"All Hail Megatron\" he gets a bitchin' robot cigar to chew on.\n Even Ratchet's G1 incarnation, who's not really intended to represent any extreme of age the way Kup is, tends to get a lot of this trope. His canon appearances as a competent medic and go-to guy paved the way for his interpretation by the fans. Fandom is especially fond of causing him to bludgeon insubordinate/uncooperative patients with wrenches and other tools, go all Doc McCoy even on Optimus Prime's aft, and generally act in a lovably codger-y manner, even ascribing him Cool Old Guy traits such as extreme shrewdness and a wrathfully protective nature regarding his crewmates (the young twins Sunstreaker and Sideswipe tend to be at the receiving end of his lectures and fists, more often than not).\n Somewhat justified by G1 Ratchet and Ironhide being the same toy with different color schemes.\n G1 Ironhide was the franchise's original Cool Old Guy . His toy card specifically states how he's the oldest Autobot, the most likely to break down from outdated parts, but too stubborn and orny to give up and quit fighting. The show just made it better by giving him a Southern grandpa accent to match.\n Vector Prime in Transformers Cybertron is both cool and so old he's made of clockwork.\n Scavenger in Transformers Armada was mentor to Optimus freaking Prime.\n And don't forget Revenge of the Fallen Jetfire.

Rat-Trap even mentions female stripper-bots with \"enhanced chest-plates\" or some such. The fact they even have strippers, to say nothing of cosmetic surgery, implies that our notions of gender roles are the same despite them being alien robots.\n For a particular aversion Strika. Yes, she is a girl.\n An earlier version of the character was even less feminine, and there was NO indication she was female when she first showed up; she pretended to have a beast-like mentality, only yelling wordlessly if she ever made any noise. When she spoke for the first time, well, huge surprise. Her earlier incarnation (a retcon naming an unnamed G1 Autobot as her) wasn't particularly shapely either, unless you count \"box\" as a shape.\n Transformers Animated Has Sari, though she's less a 'monster' than a half-Autobot",
