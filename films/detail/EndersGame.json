While Ender is doing push-ups, he continues to yell at him, telling Ender that he's never going to make commander and that Dap will never salute him. After Ender replies that Dap will, Dap adds 20 more push-ups (although he stops Ender after a few more). Finally, he yells for Ender to \"shut it\" when the boy continues to mouth off. Later, though, after Ender does make commander, Dap salutes him and treats him with respect.",
