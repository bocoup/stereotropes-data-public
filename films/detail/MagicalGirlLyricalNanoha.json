He's actually extremely handy in a fight, but he ends up accepting a position in the library of all knowledge where he can pursue his passions as an archeologist/scholar (and give more screentime to the female cast). After that, he participates in only one more fight, and the rest of the time he just researches whatever big nasty or mystery the main cast is dealing with now.\n It's possible that Yuuno remains a Non Action Guy because his one demonstrated offensive ability, forcing someone to teleport off the field against their will, offers so many unpleasant possibilities that neither he nor the series creators want to go there.",

Fate ends up returning home empty-handed, and it is at this point that we learn that Fate is a clone of Precia's biological daughter, Alicia, who has spent the past thirty years in medical stasis after a severe accident. Precia considers Fate a failed project, does not acknowledge her as a person, let alone as a daughter, and lashes her with a whip when she doesn't fulfill Precia's orders. The aforementioned scene rapidly converts most viewers' attitude from enjoying the somewhat humorous tone and subversiveness of the series to  \"PRECIA TESTAROSSA MUST DIE\".",
