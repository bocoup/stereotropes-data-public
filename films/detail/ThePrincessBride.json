The six-fingered man killed Domingo, and young Inigo immediately took up the sword and challenged the six-fingered man to a duel. He spared Inigo's life, but gave him a pair of awesome scars on his cheeks. When we meet Inigo, he's been training for the last twenty years to best the six-fingered man, working with Vizzini to pay the bills. \"There's not much money in revenge.\"\n Also in Princess Bride, there is the framing device of the grandfather reading the story to his grandson.
