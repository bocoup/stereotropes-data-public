The paper is forced to rehire Ann and hires John Willoughby to impersonate \"Doe.\" Ann and her bosses cynically milk the story for all it's worth, until the made-up \"John Doe\" philosophy starts a whole political movement. At last everyone, even Ann, takes her creation seriously...but publisher D.B. Norton has a secret plan.",
