However, she seems to be a very capricious goddess (not uncommon with sea deities actually) and was not at the designated meeting place after the ten years were up. This made Davy Jones (understandably) angry and so he and the first Brethren Court bound her in a single human form, which turned out to be Tia Dalma. When the fourth Brethren Court finally released Calypso, she was more than a little ticked off and started cursing at them in a foreign language while growing to be at least a hundred feet tall, before finally crumbling into an avalanche of rock crabs.\n It makes a bit more sense, though, when you remember that Calypso is the goddess of the sea, which by its very nature cannot be predictable. When she realized that showing up at a certain place and time would go against the unpredictable nature of the sea, she didn't come.\n You do have to remember, though, that Davy isn't unjustified in his rage, either. Part of the contract was that after ten years, when he comes back, if his love is waiting for him, he can go free. So Calypso consciously screwed him over, just for the sake of her image.\n Davy Jones could also count as a man scorned.\n Angelica in On Stranger Tides, who Jack seduced in the past and then left behind.
