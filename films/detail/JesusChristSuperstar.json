Also subverted in some of these; it's a fa\u00e7ade that he keeps to hide his actual accent. In Real Life, Herod was a notorious womanizer, and the whole Camp Gay thing was something his detractors made up to discredit him. Thus, some productions (including the 2000 film) now portray Herod as a Seedy Hollywood Agent/1980s yuppie-type who seems to be tolerating Jesus' presence as a favor to a friend. The 1996 London Cast Recording got Alice Cooper to sing the Herod song. Make of that what you will.",
