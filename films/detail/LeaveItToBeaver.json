However, Beaver continues to end up in one kind of jam or another. Unlike real life, these situations are always easily resolved to the satisfaction of all involved and the Beaver gets off with a few stern moralistic words of parental advice. Instigator and troublemaker Eddie Haskell is an older kid who always manages to avoid being caught.",

In reference to the pearls and heels while doing housework, Barbara Billingsley (may she RIP) stated that she didn't always wear them. She had a hollow in her neck that showed up quite visibly on camera. Even in later appearances/interviews, she can be seen with either a high-collared blouse or a pearl necklace covering it.
