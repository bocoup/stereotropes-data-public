    "plot": "A double-bill of thrillers that recall both filmmakers' favorite exploitation films. \"Grindhouse\" (a downtown movie theater in disrepair since its glory days as a movie palace known for \"grinding out\" non-stop double-bill programs of B-movies) is presented as one full-length feature comprised of two individual films helmed separately by each director. \"Death Proof,\" is a rip-roaring slasher flick where the killer pursues his victims with a car rather than a knife, while \"Planet Terror\" shows us a view of the world in the midst of a zombie outbreak. The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.",
