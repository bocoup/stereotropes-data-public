So she spends movie one as love interest and gets beaten by the Toad. The. Freaking. Toad (at least he was played by Ray Parks...). Movie two, she uses her powers in ways that would be perfectly unremarkable in the comics when nothing remotely Phoenix-y is going on, and everyone's amazed and a bit scared. note\u00a0Okay, maybe holding back the full fury of Scott's Eye Beams with her TK was impressive even by her comic self's standards... Movie three, she ascends into full Phoenix mode... and does nothing but be the MacGuffin of the story, sought after by the male leads (Wolverine to save her, and Magneto to make her The Dragon \u2014 a role in which she just stands around.) Even the final rampage adds little to the actual plot and only exists so Wolverine can angst about having to Shoot the Dog. (To be fair, the third movie had another problem to contend with.)",
