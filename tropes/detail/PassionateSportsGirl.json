    "description": "Female athletes are depicted differently in fiction from male athletes. While their male counterparts are usually either dumb or jerks, fictional female athletes are usually given sympathetic portrayals and more often are used to explore gender roles.\nUsually this just means that girls who like to play sports (particularly traditional male sports) are Tomboys who prefers to play with the boys. Often she can put the Jerk Jock in his place by beating him at his own sport. Of course she can vary anywhere from a girl who's sweet and shy but puts her all into the game to one who has a dark personality and just wants to play football.\nYou can tell that she's passionate because this girl lives for one sport at which she excels, or perhaps for any opportunity to show her strength, despite what anyone else thinks. In the first case, if it's a traditionally male sport, her desire to prove herself could lead to Sweet Polly Oliver as she attempts to get on an all boy team. If she plays a variety of sports then she's more likely to be the Girl Next Door. If it's a boys' team then it's You Go Girl.\nShe's also a more accessible Love Interest for the hero, since he can get to know her better by playing sports with her. There is a bit of Wish Fulfillment here for both the guys (who want a girlfriend they can talk sports with) and the girls (who want to associate themselves easier with sporty guys). On the other hand, making sports her priority can be intimidating, at least at first.\nIn works focused on female characters she is sometimes subjected to Even the Girls Want Her since her sports heroics impresses the girls, but without being as intimidating as a boy. This is particularly common in Anime. When taken to the logical extreme this can turn her into a Lesbian Jock.\nUnlike male athletes who are usually not depicted as stellar at academics, female athletes are more likely to be an Academic Athlete who has excellent grades as well. Though this isn't always the case.\nCompare Gamer Girl, another example of a female in a traditionally male-dominated medium, and also the Girly Bruiser, who can have the same passion for sports but have a Girly Girl personality.
