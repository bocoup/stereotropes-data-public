    "description": "Originally treated as a subversion of the standard gay stereotypes, the Straight Gay is a homosexual character who has no camp mannerisms or obviously 'gay' affectations.\nIn the earliest cases, Straight Gays were mostly there for farcical reasons: perhaps as a misunderstanding in which a straight character ends up unwittingly inviting himself out on a 'date' with a gay man, or in which a homophobic character espouses his views to a stranger only to find out that the person he's talking to is gay.\nCurrently, the Straight Gay is Truth in Television showing the producers understand that not all gay men are screaming 'queens' or muscleheads, or to provide a more mainstream-friendly gay character. Alternatively, the plot may hinge on characters not suspecting that a character is gay (ie. they're in the closet), or it may be so incidental to the plot that it's never actually mentioned on-screen. It's still used for cheap jokes, though.\nIn some cases \u2014 especially Soap Operas \u2014 this may be because of a Suddenly Sexuality switch for a previously heterosexual character.\nIn real life, the \"straight-acting\" behavior is sometimes criticized by members of the gay community, with some members accusing straight gays of being insecure and trying too hard to fit in with straights due to not fully accepting their homosexuality. Some people just object to the term itself, feeling that it improperly conflates masculinity with heterosexuality, implying that homosexuality is by default anti-masculine. The other side of this argument is that camp gays are putting on a false over-the-top persona (or turning existing campness it Up to Eleven) either to 'fit in' with other gays, or as an insecure reaction to a mostly straight world.\nAs a counterpoint to the above, the reason why some heterosexual people reportedly find this trope more appealing than the more Camp ones is not necessarily because of revulsion towards homosexual acts themselves. Straight gay are instead consider preferable, because the queens/flaming types are viewed as attention seekers, or predatory/megalomaniacal.\nOften involves a situation where, if the character didn't mention he was gay, the audience would never know it. Can become anvilicious depending on how long he goes on about how being gay doesn't define him, though this could also show the character's inner insecurities.\nArguably a Spear Counterpart to Lipstick Lesbian. Also compare Bi the Way, Armored Closet Gay, and Real Men Wear Pink. The Gayngster is a subset of Straight Gays who are also gangsters or criminals. Manly Gay can overlap with Straight Gay depending on the context.\nPolar opposite is Mistaken for Gay, which is often Camp Straight.\n\nExamples",
