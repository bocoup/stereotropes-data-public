    "description": "Basically Die for Our Ship, but aimed at a Real Life love interest of a celebrity or other public figure. She (and it almost always will be a woman) is hated by most of the fan base for \"stealing him away from them\", despite the painfully large probability that the fans have no hope of ever hooking up with him. The hate only intensifies if she happens to outlive him.\nSeems to be most prevalent with musicians, but also happens with actors' and athletes' love interests. Whether or not they deserve the hate is another matter entirely. Here there be Fan Dumb, for you can rest assured that it will never, ever occur to any of the people who buy into this trope that the lives and relationships of celebrities are simply none of their business.\nCharacters like this pop up in fiction, of course, and not just with musicians - any group of friends is liable to complain that the hero's new girlfriend is trying to \"break up the Five-Man Band\". If she's a Temporary Love Interest introduced solely to use this plot, the girl in question may even be a direct parody of Yoko Ono herself. Whether this character is treated with cynicism, sympathy, or indifference varies from show to show.\nRelated to Dungeonmaster's Girlfriend, if the love interest and the rest of the band don't see eye-to-eye. Also see Love Makes You Uncreative if the love interest somehow manages to adversely affect the performance of the musician, actor, athlete, writer, or artist. Sister Trope to Apple of Discord, Parent with New Paramour, and Friend Versus Lover. For the exact opposite, see Creator Couple and Contractual Purity. If you were thinking of another Yoko, see Last Kiss.",
