    "description": "Jewish boys are generally Nice Guys, or at least can be relied on being so when they're the centre piece or critical element of a given work of fiction. So are Ambiguously Jewish ones. They also tend to be self-deprecating, studious, and brainy. Although he may still love to argue, even when he's arguing, you can still tell he's nice. It's reasonably likely he's a cheapskate, but he's probably not actually greedy. They're usually Adorkable, because this is a quality favored in Jewish culture as an ideal husband: smart, reliable, and gentle, with a boyish charm.\nEven though nice Jewish boys are quite likely to cause Matzo Fever, a character referred to as \"a nice Jewish boy\" tends to be unmarried \u2014 he's often referred to as \"a nice Jewish boy\" by his domineering Jewish Mother, who wants him to get married and give her grandchildren and is advertising his niceness. Jewish Mothers may also ask their daughters to find one of these, or indeed their sons to find \"a nice Jewish girl.\"\nThe Other Wiki has an article about the \"Nice Jewish boy\".",
