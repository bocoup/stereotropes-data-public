    "description": "A female otaku who enjoys anime and manga featuring handsome men engaged in homoerotic relationships. The main difference between a Yaoi Fangirl and Guy on Guy Is Hot is that the former are interested in homoromantic/homoerotic fiction and/or fanfiction and/or Shipping, whereas the latter enjoy watching men make out. You can pretty much assume that all yaoi fangirls think Guy on Guy Is Hot, but not all women who think Guy on Guy Is Hot are yaoi fangirls.\nThe Japanese name for Yaoi Fangirl is Fujoshi (a pun that translates loosely as \"rotten girl\"). Sexually active fujoshi fantasize about having a threesome with two bisexual men while voyeur fujoshi prefer to watch gay porn. The word is often misused to mean \"female Otaku,\" causing female otaku who are not fujoshi (and know the meaning of the word) to write interminable blog posts. The male equivalent is called a Fudanshi (loosely, \"rotten man\"), but oddly enough, a lot of Fudanshis are straight or bi. Actual gay men are more likely to be into Bara Genre. In any case, Yaoi Fanboys are vanishingly rare in fiction. note\u00a0It's worth noting that if a Yaoi Fanboy is seen in a work, he will likely be a crossdresser. This is because he will inevitably hang out with girls, so he will dress like one to feel better about himself.\nYaoi Fangirls are somewhat infamous due to the subsets that think Het is Ew and engage in Wimpification. In series where Yaoi Fangirls are seen, at least one joke will be made that involves the Yaoi fangirl's dirty imagination and at least one of the male characters. This often goes hand in hand with said yaoi fangirl having a (usually rare for females) nosebleed.\nObviously Truth in Television, particularly in Japan, though this character type is less common in anime than the Cosplay Otaku Girl, due to this character type having less appeal to male anime fans.\nSee also Slash Fic, Most Fanfic Writers Are Girls, Guy on Guy Is Hot. Compare Yuri Fan and Girl on Girl Is Hot for the female-on-female equivalents. Related to the Fag Hag.\n\nExamples",
