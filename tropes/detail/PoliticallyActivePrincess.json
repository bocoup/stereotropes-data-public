    "description": "The Politically-Active Princess is a princess that takes active interest in and plays an active role in politics. Naive courtiers and commoners alike might view her only as a figurehead, but in truth, she discreetly uses her position and guiles in order to achieve her ends. Skilled in diplomacy, she will usually attempt to solve conflicts via conversation or bargaining, rather than combat. Her defining trait is her involvement in politics or diplomatic matters, without letting herself serve only as a bargaining chip. That, however, does not mean she cannot be a Lady of War or a Badass Princess at the same time.\nAlthough historically neither princes nor princesses were expected to involve themselves in such matters, in fiction, this trope is Always Female, as male royals are typically expected to act, while females... not so much.\nA Sub-Trope of Royals Who Actually Do Something.\nA Sister Trope to Princesses Rule.\nCompare Rebellious Princess, Spirited Young Lady, Silk Hiding Steel, Badass Princess.\nContrast Princess Classic.",
