    "description": "Typically, a woman who wears a midriff-revealing outfit and a lot of jewelry. She does movements of her hips and stomach that can mesmerize onlookers. Occasionally, men do belly dancing too, but this is less common and may be played up for humor or Fan Disservice.\nOften occurs in the Middle East. Serious performers of the sophisticated genuine article began to refer to it as \"Middle Eastern Dance\" in the 1980s. Strictly speaking, what Westerners think of as belly dance is the Arabic raqs sharqi style. Some historians believe it was a way of exercising the muscles of the pelvis and abdominal area for women who were pregnant or had menstruation problems; or that it was part of a religious ceremony. Nowadays it's more for entertainment purposes, although it can be utilized as a form of exercise, too.\nNote that the revealing outfits are purely an invention and misconception of people who don't know anything about belly dancing; female dancers of the original raqs sharqi style dressed more conservatively.\nIf a character dresses like a belly dancer, but is not actually a dancer, she is a Bedlah Babe.\nPlease place only particularly notable real-life examples in the Real Life section.",
