    "description": "So you meet and befriend some older guy on your quest to save the world. He's big, loud, much older than you, and probably ugly as sin\u2014but he's fun to be around and you generally respect him. Some time after you become friends, you learn that he has a daughter. More than that, he's already set you two up on a blind date.\nOkay, you can deal with that. She won't be pretty, but she'll probably be nice enough. You don't want to insult the father and after the whole thing you can probably just say that she's not your type\u2014mother of God is that her?! Daaaaaayumn.\nCongratulations, you've just met The Ugly Guy's Hot Daughter. Sometimes, not only is there a lack of Strong Family Resemblance, but they barely even look like they're of the same species. Often this will be handwaved by making the girl the spitting image of her mother instead or by stating that daddy used to be quite a catch, but the point stands that she looks nothing like her undeniably unattractive father.\nThis trope usually only applies to girls (though not without exceptions), but you probably knew that already. Often the ugly guy is the villain.\nDaughter of Ugly Guy, Hot Wife (unless...). The twin sister of the Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter. In Science Fiction and Fantasy stories, can combine with Cute Monster Girl as a form of Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism. Contrast Strong Family Resemblance.",
