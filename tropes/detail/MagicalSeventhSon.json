    "description": "The number seven is often considered magical, and in folklore, the seventh son of a seventh son is often considered to have inherent magical powers like second sight. In fiction, and sometimes song, this is often shortened to just the seventh son, though seventh sons were common enough (up until the 20th Century) that this makes little sense.\nA common version of the legend says that the seventh son of a seventh son will be born with a caul (actually a loose flap of amniotic sac) over his face, to signify the Seer-like powers.\nCharacters often claim to be a seventh son of a seventh son, to help convince others that they have magical powers, even in stories where magic is not real.\nAlmost Always Male, possibly because \"seventh daughter of a seventh daughter\" doesn't quite roll off the tongue.\nA subtrope of Rule of Seven, related to Lucky Seven.",
