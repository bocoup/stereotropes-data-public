    "description": "A female character added to a new season, spinoff or sequel to balance out the sexes.\nIf she's the first female in a previously all-male cast, this is just The Smurfette Principle at work and she's probably The Chick or The Heart. But if she's added when there's already a (single) female in the cast, to counter the Smurfette Principle by adding more gender balance, then she's an Affirmative Action Girl. When this trope was in its formative stages (when Affirmative Action was still working its way into action-oriented fiction), such characters were usually Straw Feminists to boot. For bonus points, she might be a racial minority as well.\nNote that despite the Punny Name, she need not be an Action Girl, but usually is at least a Tomboy to distinguish her from a pre-existing Chick.\nIf used well, she can genuinely enrich the story. But if she's just there and has no characterization or Character Development, she merely becomes a Mary Sue, or a Creator's Pet for everyone to hate.\nSee also Affirmative Action Legacy and Two Girls to a Team.",
