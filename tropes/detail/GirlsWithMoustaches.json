    "description": "This trope applies to any female character who sports a moustache or beard at some point. This is almost inevitably Played for Laughs.\nThe most common variant involves a woman wearing a fake moustache, possibly as part of a Sweet Polly Oliver, or temporarily growing one due to some form of Applied Phlebotinum. Sometimes it may even just be a part of an Imagine Spot. Permanently moustachioed women are rarer. If they do appear, expect them to be a part of a Freak Show as \"The Bearded Lady\".\nIf female dwarves appear, they are likely to sport beards similar to those of the males.\nNot to be confused with Moustache de Plume.\n\nExamples",
