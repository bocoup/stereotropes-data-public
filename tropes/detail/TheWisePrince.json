    "description": "The Wise Prince is an example of the non evil Aristocrat. He's kind, honorable and well-intentioned, but with an aura of sadness and melancholy surrounding him. His biggest priority is the protection of his people, and, unlike the pampered Sheltered Aristocrat, fully understands the hardship of an unprivileged life. He is usually a good warrior, but doesn't like fighting.\nHe's often short of being an All-Loving Hero, but doesn't always live in the right Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism for it. If he doesn't, his disillusioned gallantry can be just as poignant.\nYou'd think he'd make a perfect leader for his people, of course, but fate is particularly skilled at screwing him over in some way or another. If he does reign he feels his responsibilities perhaps too keenly.\nHe might start out being the Rebel Prince or Sheltered Aristocrat. The Evil Prince is his opposite (and sometimes his brother). See also The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask.\nOften the son of the Fisher King, who has gone away and left his people in disarray. Unlike other aristocrats, the Wise Prince must typically journey somewhere, which will hopefully culminate in the Rightful King Returns. If successful, expect the Wise Prince to rule long and happily as The Good King.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next steps down are The Caligula, The Good Chancellor, Standard Royal Court and Deadly Decadent Court. The next steps up are The Good King, God Save Us from the Queen!, The High Queen, and The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask.",
