    "description": "When it comes to women in positions of power with royal lineage, there are two flavors. On one hand, you have the evil, power-hungry bitches. And on the other hand, you have this trope.\nA woman of wealth, power and near-impossible beauty. She always has a calm demeanor and regal bearing. Her very voice, even if it doesn't ring with power (and it often does), still lets you know that, in some way, she's probably better than you, even if the lady herself doesn't look down on you at all.\nHer beauty can often be so great, even simple robes look majestic on her.\nHer beauty and goodness are usually to be admired passionately but from some distance. The High Queen is rarely a love interest, but the few times she is, expect a little warming up due to the charms of the hero.\nA common characterization for non-evil regnant queens, princesses (the more mature ones) and goddesses (especially the non-evil/bastardy ones). May also be the polar opposite of the Rich Bitch. This is what The Ojou and Princess Classic want to be when they grow up. If she can fight, she's a Lady of War. Sometimes we get to see glimpses \u2014 or the whole story from the POV \u2014 of The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask. She's also very likely to have a Lady and Knight relationship with one of her subjects at some point. For the others, she typically commands such high respect and devotion that her subjects will march to and fight at the Gates of Hell without question if she needed them to.\nLike other \u00dcber-character types, The High Queen runs a risk of becoming a Mary Sue, though mostly an acceptable one at that.\nThe presence of a High Queen is sometimes an indication of a Matriarchy.\nThe Iron Lady is the non-royal version of this trope; because non-royals have to fight for their position, such characters generally combine elements of The High Queen and God Save Us from the Queen!. If she literally fights, she is a Lady of War. If her fighting is more indirect and subtle, she is Silk Hiding Steel.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are God Save Us from the Queen!, The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, She Is the King, Iron Lady, The Good King and President Evil. The next steps down are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next step up is The Emperor.",
