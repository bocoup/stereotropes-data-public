    "description": "Your less-developed fantasy worlds will contain no castle underlings save guards and kitchen staff. The guards lead a sad existence as Red Shirts, but the latter option presents a marvelous opportunity for anyone willing to submit to a little drudgery, if she can only get herself placed as a Scullery Maid.\nIf she's in for infiltration, scullery maids (or any other menial help staff) are practically invisible. They don't get very much access to sensitive areas of the castle, it is true, but chances are someone will notice our heroine's talents and give her a promotion, or else that she'll have a knack for attracting Exact Eavesdropping. If the infiltration has some sort of assassination in mind, kitchen staff have a perfect opportunity to poison people. If there's a ball, promotions can go quite high. It is, indeed the go-to job for runaway Fairy Tale Princesses.\nIf she's simply hiding out, believe me, no one suspects that The Chosen One is sweating over boiling potatoes.\nEven if she's basically been enslaved into such a position, the Scullery Maid will find some way to prevail. Contrast with Meido, French Maid, and Ninja Maid for less realistic interpretations of the role. For reference, the scullery is a small, hot, sweaty room behind the kitchen, where heavy, dirty, menial work, such as cleaning pots and pans, is carried out.\nThe Spear Counterpart is also found, particularly in works more carefully based on the High Middle Ages or earlier. Compare Farm Boy.\n\nExamples",
