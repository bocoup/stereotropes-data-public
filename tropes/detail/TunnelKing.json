    "description": "A Tunnel King is a character who is an expert in, well, tunneling. His solution to any problem is likely to be \"We'll dig our way out.\" Carrying the trope to its extreme, the Tunnel King may dwell Beneath the Earth in an underground civilization that he constructed himself.\nIn animated series, this character will often be a burrowing animal with their digging abilities carried to ludicrous extremes.\nHuman versions of this character are almost always nicknamed The Mole, but that title was already taken for a different trope. Mole Miners and Mole Men are often this.",
