    "description": "So you are a freak of nature, a witch, a Super Hero, or a Chosen One. You are loaded with supernatural powers, and between going to work or school you have some world saving duties to attend to that need to be kept secret. And on top of that, you also need to balance it out with a love life!\nBut you can't tell your boyfriend about it! He'd freak out and leave you, or worse. But then, you can't keep it a secret forever, either. At some point, one of your supernatural incidents will inevitably happen exactly when you were having a romantic dinner. Or maybe your relationship has simply reached the next level, and you feel that you need to be completely honest with him.\nSo what now? How will he react? Well, it turns out he's perfectly okay with it (well, for the most part) and completely understands. That's right, as a reward for your sacrifices, the Powers That Be will make sure that you end up with a truly noble and loving soul who loves you for who you are and doesn't care what you are. So no worries!\nThis trope is a Double Standard, in that wives and girlfriends are pretty much automatically accepting of their Action Hero husband/boyfriend's actions, whereas the number of husbands/boyfriends who automatically accept that their significant other is an Action Girl are pretty thin on the ground. For the guy who is a super and needs a girlfriend, his powers are often a plus for her because it makes him more amazing. For women, finding a guy who truly doesn't have a problem with dating someone with superpowers when he's a Muggle is the bigger issue, because, well, No Guy Wants an Amazon.\nCompare Freakiness Shame, when a disguise forms part of the powers. Compare to Violently Protective Girlfriend for the Action Girl variant. Compare and contrast Non-human Lover Reveal, for the guy/girl who is on the other end of this trope. See also The Masquerade Will Kill Your Dating Life, which is an aversion of this trope.",
