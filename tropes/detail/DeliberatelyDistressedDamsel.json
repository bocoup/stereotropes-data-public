    "description": "That Alice! She seems Too Dumb to Live. She picks up the Distress Ball and, like a true Damsel Scrappy, scores on her own team with it. And worse, she seems like she's enjoying it.\nWhile this character may look like a Damsel Scrappy at first glance, she's actually Obfuscating Stupidity. Whether she's pulling a Wounded Gazelle Gambit, or just into this sort of thing, she doesn't get captured because she's weak, she gets captured because she wants to. She may even have the skills to get out of the scrape she's in herself if necessary. If this is the case, expect her to say Let's Get Dangerous at some point.\nIf she's getting captured because she's into it, she may be a case of Best Her to Bed Her. Expect her not to have much regard for Safe, Sane and Consensual. If her getting captured is part of her Evil Plan, she's really a Decoy Damsel.\nCompare I Surrender, Suckers, and Aren't You Going to Ravish Me?.\n\nExamples",
