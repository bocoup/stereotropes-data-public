    "description": "A subtrope of Parental Abandonment: The mother of a character or characters is missing or absent.\nPerhaps she died. Perhaps she left and there's bitterness involved. Perhaps she's a Damsel in Distress. Regardless of what happened \u2014 and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened \u2014 Dad seems to have raised his children on his own, or with help from a mom-substitute.\nMissing Moms are often considered more unusual than a missing father, and are more likely to have their absence explicitly explained. This might be because a man can technically leave his babymamma at any time after knocking her up (or she can leave him) \u2014 it's even possible for him to never find out he's a father. But a woman carrying a child to term and giving birth, then disappearing, is rarer, especially if it was by her own choice, since it contradicts the Closer to Earth image most cultures have of women. If it was Death by Childbirth that disposed of the mother, this is usually mentioned because it adds an extra touch of tragedy to the character's life.\nHowever, the flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all. Missing Moms in general are likely to get a brief mention as to what happened to them, but are far less likely to turn up again in the story, and less likely to be a driving force behind a hero's adventures.\nMissing Moms are almost always remembered in a positive light, unlike Disappeared Dads (although see First Father Wins). Expect the father to wax poetic about the times they shared, and to tell a female hero \"You look so much like your mother.\" Death by Childbirth can be a cause of this. (By contrast, if the Missing Mom is alive and willingly abandoned her child, she will probably be portrayed as worse than an absentee dad note\u00a0 expect in some period stories \u2014 before the 20th century, children of divorced or legally separated couples were invariably awarded to the father.) This beatification can also lead the way to a Wicked Stepmother if the father remarries, or a child's Tell Me About My Mother. If the mother is dead, the surviving spouse is almost obligated to have a Happier Home Movie about her, such as a wedding video or one with the hero as a baby.\nCombine with Disappeared Dad, and you get Parental Abandonment.\n\nExamples",
