    "description": "A Chick Magnet is a guy who draws girls to him like bears to honey. He's not The Casanova or Kavorka Man, but he pulls girls in about as fast as they do, if not faster. Unlike these scoundrels, even when he does finally realize the feelings of the girls around him, he never tries to take advantage of them. He can charm the pants off any girl, of about any age, without even trying, and he usually doesn't. He may not know just the right things to say to a girl, but says them anyway. This usually means he ends up with two or more girls vying for his affections at the same time.\nAs the description implies, this trope is almost always applied to male characters, due to various Double Standards, along with not a small amount of wish fulfillment. When the Gender Inversion does happen they are usually referred to as a Dude Magnet, this trope's alternate title.\nOverlaps often with the Unlucky Everydude and occasionally Unwanted Harem. Chaste Heroes and Celibate Heroes are highly likely to be this. May result in the Magnet invoking Love You and Everybody if the Magnet doesn't want to break their hearts, or lose any of them if/when they finally choose the person they really love. Cranking this magnetism up results in Even the Guys Want Him/Even the Girls Want Her.\nSee Mr. Fanservice/Ms. Fanservice for characters designed to be a magnet for real-world people. Compare Clueless Chick Magnet, when the Chick Magnet doesn't even notice the effect they have, and The Charmer, who is seen as charismatic by others, including men. Compare Hello, Nurse!.",
