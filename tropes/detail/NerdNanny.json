    "description": "You are one of Two Gamers on a Couch, enthralled by the latest noisy console game. As you furiously punish the controller old potato chips fly from your shirt, illuminated briefly by the glow of the screen before disappearing into the darkness of the room around you. You feel the sweet victory over your rival drawing near. As you are about to deliver the final blow, a mysterious figure steps between you and the television. Who could it be? Oh, it's just your extremely hot female roommate trying to get you to do something other than play video games. Whatever, you will unpause the game after you pretend to listen to what she says.\nThis girl is the Nerd Nanny, and how she winds up living with a bunch of lazy guys is a mystery. Even more amazing is the fact that the guys never seem to notice how frickin hot she is, unless some story-driving UST is needed. She is constantly trying to motivate the Non Action Guys to do anything, sometimes even to pay attention to her, but they usually won't have any of it. Fortunately for our male castmembers, she almost never leaves them for a different housing situation, because if she did\u2014well, who would want to watch a show without hot chicks in it? Am I Right??\nNote the guys don't always have to be nerds. Any reason to be couch-ridden also works (e.g. drugs, lazyness, etc.).\nThis character is popular in webcomics and sitcoms, but is present in other genres as well.\nCompare Ignore the Fanservice. Related to Magical Girlfriend, Team Mom, Action Girl, The Chick, Cloudcuckoolander's Minder and Closer to Earth. See also Ugly Guy, Hot Wife, Odd Couple. Compare Give Geeks a Chance and Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl. Contrast Gamer Chick.\n\nExamples",
