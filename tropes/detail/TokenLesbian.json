    "description": "Any work with a predominantly gay male cast will always feature a single lesbian or lesbian couple. It doesn't matter how tenuous their ties with the boys are (usually the main character's best friend and her lover), or if they integrate with the main cast at all. As with any token, they're not there to actually add to the story, but to keep people from complaining that it's not inclusive enough (after all, an all-gay-male cast is still an all-male cast). It's not even guaranteed that they'll pass The Bechdel Test. And you can bet your next paycheck that their plot will involve having children in some way, since All Lesbians Want Kids.\nIt is also worth noting that works centering around gay women never include a token male couple in such a way.\nPlease note that this is a very specific trope. If the ladies are the only gay couple shown, then they're token gays. If the work features couples of all stripes, then they're simply part of the bigger picture. This trope is about those lesbians arbitrarily thrown into a work about the lives of gay men. Related to The Smurfette Principle.",
