    "description": "The World's Strongest Man is a character who is, well \u2014 the strongest man in the world or universe, or, at the very least the strongest human. He may be brainy or stupid (sometimes he Does Not Know His Own Strength), attractive or ugly, but one thing is for sure \u2014 you don't want to mess with him, as he will most definitely wipe the floor with you. He may be going on The Hero's Journey, or he may just be full of himself and his power. If he's a villain, he's often either the Big Bad or The Dragon.\nThis trope may be played with by Samus Is a Girl or Fake Ultimate Hero. See also Super Strength. Note that this trope refers to a character type, determining just who is the strongest leads to arguments about Character Tiers.\nMay overlap with World's Best Warrior, although \"best warrior\" doesn't necessarily mean \"strongest\". World's Most Beautiful Woman might be an arguable Distaff Counterpart, because Men Are Strong, Women Are Pretty.\n\nExamples",
