    "description": "An Always Male character devoted to enforcing the standards and principles regarding how \"real men\" act and behave, whether it's around women or otherwise. One of his top priorities is maintaining the comfort, safety, and reputation of ladies, thinking that the idea of a woman being One of the Boys is plain old wrong. His ideals go beyond common courtesy.\nAny attempts to resist or otherwise convince said character of how horrifically archaic his principles are mostly never come up or fall flat on their faces, but a rare success will result in a wake up call to the man that he might be trapped in the wrong era or the wrong culture.\nIf he practices what he preaches, especially if it's in terms of romance, then he will probably win over the other characters like a natural Prince Charming. If one of these characters is female, then you have Single Woman Seeks Good Man. If his ladylove is similarly old-fashioned, they become a Lady and Knight couple. Some hand-kissing may be in order, too.\nIf he's not just a gentleman, but an Officer and a Gentleman, he probably belongs to an order of knighthood and follows the more classic code of chivalry. In that case see Knight in Shining Armor. He might also be a Sharp-Dressed Man.\nContrast Stay in the Kitchen, where the male character may hold such old-fashioned ideals with less than noble intentions. Compare Prince Charming Wannabe.",
