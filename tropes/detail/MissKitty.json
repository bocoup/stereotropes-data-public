    "description": "What is the fate of a Soiled Dove as she grows older? It all depends on how much she's been soiled and who was documenting the events. In early versions of the Romance Novel, any soiling was considered an impurity that could not be erased, so Redemption Equals Death was a common ending to the story, usually with the Soiled Dove ending up addicted to alcohol and/or opiates and Dying Alone in some gutter. In Real Life, though, many a Soiled Dove ended up marrying and leaving what was then called the Sporting Life. This was especially true in The Wild West, where women were at a premium. Some ended up becoming a Determined Homesteader's Wife. Their former lives were generally not held against them, and the act of marriage bestowed social respectability on them.\nFiction provided another solution, though. The Miss Kitty is a Soiled Dove turned entrepreneur. She is the proprietor of the local drinking establishment, very often a Fish out of Water. Sometimes, she has obtained her establishment through the circumstances of becoming a Determined Widow. She is always of a certain age. She is tough as nails. She has an unlimited supply of something that passes for whiskey, with sasparilla for the Determined Homesteader's Children. She has no tolerance for \"rowdiness\" in her establishment and very often has a shotgun handy to make certain that her policy is enforced. She goes out of her way to make certain that no one mistreats her \"girls\". She acts as mother-confessor for anyone in town and always has time to provide people with advice and common-sense wisdom. Occasionally, Preacher Man berates her for operating a Den of Iniquity, but most of the time he accepts her business as a necessary evil. She is almost always on the side of the angels.\nInitially, Bowdlerization restricted her activities to running a saloon. In today's media, most establishments run by a Miss Kitty are more obviously brothels with ancillary booze service.\nIf the two are close in age, she will be the love interest of The Sheriff or the U.S. Marshal. She is the employer of the Dance Hall Girl and The Piano Player. The Bartender is always her trusted subordinate, if she employs one.\nThe Miss Kitty is restricted in time and setting. She will be almost exclusively found either in the United States or Canada. In the US, she'll be found between 1860 (the start of the American Civil War) and 1911 (the year the Everleigh Club in Chicago was closed). In Canada she'll usually be in shows set in Alberta or the North (especially the Klondike), and can show up at a much later date than in the US \u2014 as late as the mid-1950s for shows set in the Territories. She can also be found in Speculative Fiction that uses a setting that is analogous. The Wild West is her natural habitat, but she can often be found in urban red-light districts of the period. The Miss Kitty does not necessarily have to be female, although the nurturing aspects of a Miss Kitty are more of a female trait.\nThe trope was so pervasive in Western Canada in the post-World War I era that the phrasing \"Miss Firstname\" was (and to some extent, still is) used only to refer to madams and whores. This naturally surprises visitors from the southern US, for whom this phrasing is a respectable way for children to refer to adult women. Hilarity can ensue.\nThe Trope Namer is Miss Kitty, the proprietor of the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City in Gunsmoke. Should not be confused with the burlesque dancer in The Great Mouse Detective or former WWE Diva Stacy Carter, who used this name before changing it to The Kat.",
