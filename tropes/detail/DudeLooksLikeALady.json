    "description": "Whether it is due to their gorgeous hair, delicate features, snazzy dressing, or fey nature, some boys get called \"little lady\" more often than they'd like. The opposite of Lady Looks Like a Dude, this trope involves male characters who are frequently mistaken for female (by other characters).\nNot to be confused with:\n Wholesome Crossdresser (when the dude wants to look like a girl)\n Viewer Gender Confusion (when you mistake a character's gender)\n Bish\u014dnen (male characters who are feminine or androgynous-looking \u2014 some of those dudes do look like ladies, but what separates it from this trope is that it's normally not commented on by other characters)\n Disguised in Drag (when the dude's dressing as a girl only for a specific reason)\n Man, I Feel Like a Woman   (that's a whole 'nother story entirely)\n Transsexual (when the \"dude\" identifies as a girl and is trying to pass as one)\n Everybody Wants the Hermaphrodite (when the \"dude\" has female parts as well as male ones)\nFrequently results in an Unsettling Gender-Reveal; the difference is how much another character has invested in the dude actually being a lady (The Crying Game versus any scene with Kazuki in Get Backers).\nNamed for the Aerosmith song, a Real Life example as it was allegedly written about M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce frontman Vince Neil.\nCompare Ambiguous Gender and Bifauxnen.",
