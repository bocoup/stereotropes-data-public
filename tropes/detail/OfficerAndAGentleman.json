    "description": "These guys are considered the model military officers. Most forms of media will typically portray the Officer and a Gentleman as being a member of the upper-class in whatever society he originates, and almost undoubtedly attended a Military Academy. If this character is a British officer (or speaking with an English accent), you can often tell whether he is an officer and a gentleman because he will almost invariably speak with a Received Pronunciation (i.e., the Queen\u2019s English). If he's American, he will either be a Southerner with a soft voice but pronounced Tidewater or Dixie accent (especially if in the Army), or a Northeastern gent with Mid-Atlantic tones (particularly in the Navy).\nBesides typically being a member of the upper crust, an officer and gentleman is personified by his behavior: No matter how savage the fighting, no matter how pitiless the combat, the officer almost never lets his base nature take over. He will remain polite, and even in the worst of situations will always retain his sense of propriety, often unfailingly displaying a Stiff Upper Lip. If a more clever sort, he may be a Gentleman Snarker. After all, a gentleman is not a mere label, but a way of life.\nFor example, an officer and a gentleman will rarely if ever cuss, and never knowingly in the presence of a lady. He will rarely drink to the point of inebriation, unless it is used for comedic purposes or to tragically show how the war may be taking a toll on him. He would never, ever take advantage of a lady, and will be very protective of women, both of their persons and their sensibilities, even when it is not merited. Further, if you insult his honour, or worse, the honour of a lady he fancies, you may earn yourself a challenge to a duel, unless profuse apology is the next thing out of your mouth. Otherwise, expect a fair, gentlemanly duel in which he will proceed to carve you into cutlets. However, he would not think of fighting dirty, and most certainly Would Not Shoot a Civilian on purpose. On the other hand, if he is evil, he might have some of his less honourable henchmen do the Dirty Business for him. Further, whether good or bad, he will always keep his word. . .after all, he gave his word as a gentleman. Characters typifying this trope often have the habit, for better or worse, of displaying Honour Before Reason.\nDo not misunderstand\u2014this fellow can be just as deadly as any other warrior; often more so, because one aspect that is often used with this trope is the fact that the more experienced officers are typically very composed and often have Nerves of Steel, making them less likely to act irrationally or misstep. However, while his training and experience may have forged him into a very skilled fighter, he will rarely be a Combat Pragmatist, and can often fall victim to more unsporting chaps.\nWhen it comes to actual leadership ability, the Officer and a Gentleman runs the gamut. If portrayed in a good light, the officer will be shown as being a Reasonable Authority Figure, like The Brigadier, and if he takes pains to look out for his soldier\u2019s wellbeing, he is A Father to His Men. In a really positive light, they may be shown to be great front-line leaders and warriors as well, playing the role of Colonel or General Badass. If they are being portrayed in a negative light, they will be the General Ripper or The Neidermeyer. If they are cruel and/or incompetent, they will most likely be portrayed as a General Failure. While these more negative incarnations may be just as dedicated to politeness and etiquette as the good ones, their good behaviour is reserved for their superiors and people of proper social rank, rather than the rabble of men they lead. Further, the evil officer would not hesitate saying \"We Have Reserves.\" After all, the only ones whose lives are at risk are the commoner soldiers, and who cares about them?\nRemember, what separates this character from the Proud Warrior Race Guy or the Warrior Poet is not only the character\u2019s devotion to honour, but to a set of \"gentlemanly\" principles, which include good manners and etiquette. Most representations of the officer and gentleman are most certainly Lawful Good or at least Lawful Neutral. If on the side of the antagonists, or the major antagonist himself, he will often be Lawful Evil, and is often portrayed as an Anti-Villain. Satirical versions of this trope are often represented as being Lawful Stupid.\nCompare with Knight Errant and Knight in Shining Armor. Contrast Up Through the Ranks (for an officer who isn't a gentleman) and Gentlemen Rankers (when a gentleman isn't an officer). If during peacetime the Officer and a Gentleman was an academic, then he is a Gentleman and a Scholar. If there's focus on the gentleman part then he follows the code of Old-School Chivalry.\nNot to be confused with the film, An Officer and a Gentleman, the 1982 movie with Richard Gere and Deborah Winger.",
