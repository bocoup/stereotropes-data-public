    "description": "This is a maritime Badass Grandpa. He has endured storms, pirates, fog, and all the perils of the sea. He has been in a Bar Brawl in every port and he has never lost. Sometimes he is a Drill Sergeant Nasty to all the scurvy foc'sle swabs. Sometimes he develops a Big Brother Instinct toward the Plucky Middie. But he is a lord of the sea and all sailors must heed him or endure his wrath. Often wears a Sea Dog Beard.\nIf he actually serves in a Navy then he's likely to cross over with Old Soldier.",
