    "description": "The Jewish American Princess is a pejorative Jewish American woman stereotype that is portrayed as materialistic, selfish, and from a pampered or wealthy background. The term, \"Jewish American Princess\" is often abbreviated to the acronym \"JAP.\"\nThe Jewish American princess stereotype was a construct of and popularized by post-war Jewish male writers. Notable works that popularized this stereotype are Herman Wouk's 1955 novel, Marjorie Morningstar and Philip Roth's 1959 novel Goodbye, Columbus.\nThe acronym, \"JAP\" and the associated stereotype gained attention in the 1970s with the publication of several non-fiction articles. Barbara Meyer's Cosmopolitan article \"Sex and the Jewish Girl\" and the 1971 cover article in New York Magazine by Julie Baumgold, \"The Persistence of the Jewish Princess\" are two such notable articles. The Jewish American Princess stereotype's rise to prominence in the 1970s resulted from pressures on the Jewish middle class to maintain a visibly affluent lifestyle as post-war affluence declined.\nThe stereotype is portrayed as over-indulged by her parents with attention and money. This results in the princess having both unrealistic expectations and guilt and skill in the manipulation of guilt in others, which results in a deficient love life. The stereotype is also portrayed as sexually-repressive, overly-concerned with appearance, and indifferent to sex, the latter her most notable trait.\nValley Girl is a Sister Trope. Some of these girls can fall under Spoiled Brat or Idle Rich.",
