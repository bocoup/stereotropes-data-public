    "description": "A husband who is usually seen lounging around at home while his wife does all the housework, rarely seen getting to relax. She often berates him for being lazy.\nSometimes the Lazy Husband is a bit bossy and expects everyone to wait on him, and sometimes he's just more laid-back. His laziness often extends to work as well.\nDepending on who is portrayed as more sympathetic, this could overlap with either Women Are Wiser (if the husband being lazy is emphasized, especially in the cases where he's also lazy at work) or Henpecked Husband (if the wife is portrayed as being overly naggy and bossy \u2014 especially if she complains whenever he does something, even if he does it right). Also similar to Bumbling Dad, but this is more about the husband-wife dynamic than just focusing on the dad being stupid (and not all Lazy Husbands are fathers).\nContrast House Husband.
