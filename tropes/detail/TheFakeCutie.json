    "description": "While The Cutie is known for being a character that is sweet, lovable and innocent, some characters, while apparently cute, aren\u2019t as innocent as they seem.\nThe Fake Cutie is either a full-grown woman or otherwise mature person, but insists on dressing, speaking and acting like a child, sometimes to a sickening degree, or at least much younger than she is in order to be cute and \"get dates\" or other benefits.\nThis cutie act is actually camouflage to hide her intelligence, her true self, her nefarious intentions, or her insane jealousy. She tends to be very manipulative and is often murderously dangerous to those that see Beneath the Mask.\nShe is the cute counterpart of the Stepford Smiler, and may even be her daughter. The Bitch in Sheep's Clothing is her meaner sister. The fully grown Fake Cutie is invariably a Psychopathic (Wo)manChild.\nCompare Deliberately Cute Child, Kawaiiko, Keet, The Ingenue, Kiddie Kid, The Cutie and Dawson Casting.\n\nExamples",
