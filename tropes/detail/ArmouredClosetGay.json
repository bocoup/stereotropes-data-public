    "description": "He's the strongest, toughest, manliest man in the sports team. He might hate gays and be vocal, or even violent about it. He will remind everybody that he is completely, 100% straight. That is, during the daytime. When night falls, you can find him Where Everybody Knows Your Flame with the Club Kids and Gym Bunnies. He's the self-loathing gay guy who hides behind a macho fa\u00e7ade.\nPerhaps the most common variant of You Are What You Hate. See also Gayngst if the character is particularly self-tormented about it. Not to be confused with Straight Gay, who is out of the closet but just non-flamboyant, or Gym Bunny or Manly Gay, also out of the closet and macho all the same.\nPolar opposite of Gay Bravado - acting gay to affirm your heterosexuality - unless it's a double bluff, of course. Sometimes overlaps with Gayngster. May result in Irrational Hatred of gays.",
