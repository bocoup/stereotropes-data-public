    "description": "Some girls act like guys. Some go as far as being almost considered guys. Most of them are portrayed as feminists (often the straw kind), but then there are these. They will call people \"girl\" and \"sissy\" as insults. They think that women should Stay in the Kitchen, and they're against all kinds of women's rights. They're Female Misogynists. People will remind them that they're girls themselves, but they will deny it - or consider themselves a \"honorary dude\" or claim they're \"not like the other girls\" (i.e. they're ''better'' than the other girls, in their minds). Another variation is the extremely conservative housewife, who thinks that women are inferior to men. Alternatively, this can actually be combined with a Straw Feminist, making a character who hates all men and believes they're naturally sexual predators, but will attack and abuse any female that doesn't fit their idea of what 'feminism' should be; expect slut shaming, high expectations, hatred towards The Chick or The Medic (if the medic is female) and distaste for more effeminate women.\nSubtrope of Boomerang Bigot. In the rare case that she also applies the misogyny to herself as well (through being self-hating and/or limiting her life needlessly) it also becomes Internalized Categorism. Compare/contrast with Effeminate Misogynistic Guy, except that the contradiction is much more direct. See also, Territorial Smurfette, where the female lead will act antagonistic towards a new woman in the group.",
