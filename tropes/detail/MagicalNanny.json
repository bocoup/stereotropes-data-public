    "description": "A Magical Nanny is a woman who is hired to look after children, but ends up having a profound effect on the whole family. She may have genuine magical powers or she may just have a magical effect on the household. Even children who have scared off a number of previous nannies can be tamed by a Magical Nanny.\nMagical Nannies come in two flavors:\nA free spirited nanny will often be seen in households with strict parents, who are often cold and neglectful toward the children. She will encourage them to be themselves and talk about The Power of Love. Eventually this message will spread to the parents, drawing the family together. This type of Magical Nanny is often musically talented.\nA sensible nanny will usually work for aloof or ineffectual parents with rambunctious children. She will be strict, but fair and impose a sense of structure on a family that badly needs it. Before long, the parents will be in awe of her \u2014 perhaps after a stage of resenting how their lavishness did not win the children's hearts but her firmness (and attention!) did \u2014 and any naughty children will have learned that behaving themselves can be fun.\nA sub-flavor includes magical nannies that are literally Magical Nannies. Often they will be a parody or even Deconstruction of the Ur Example, Mary Poppins.\nWhile Magical Nannies are often threatened with the sack, they are not easy to get rid of. When their employment ends, it will be on their own terms. Typically they will decide that their work here is done or they will stay and marry the head of the household. (Note that they never become the Wicked Stepmother.) The latter is particularly common in the Romance Novel; indeed, the heroine may become the stepmother first and still fulfill the role of Magical Nanny.\nCompare Fairy Godmother.\nContrast the Babysitter From Hell and the Badly Battered Babysitter.",
