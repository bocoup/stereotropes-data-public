    "description": "This trope characterizes women as less rational, disciplined, and emotionally stable than men, and thus more prone to mood swings, irrational overreactions, and mental illness.note\u00a0The ancient Greeks believed that a woman's uterus would move out of place and attack other organs, causing all sorts of maladies, both mental and physical. The trope name comes from the Greek word hysteros, womb or uterus. As a result female characters may be coddled, or their opinions undervalued. In Western works it's more likely to affect female characters over the age of 30 and who are Hollywood Homely and/or Hollywood Pudgy; bonus points if she's a Housewife.\nA blatant Double Standard, it was used and invoked quite freely in older works. These days it is rarely invoked, as most people are aware of the obvious Unfortunate Implications. Despite that it's still more common to portray female characters becoming emotionally overwrought when under stress or behaving more irrationally than men, even when it would be out-of-character. Male characters like this are likely to be unsympathetic or comedic. An insensitive male character may ask, \"Are you on your period?\" or something on those lines.\nCompare The Ophelia which is about genuine insanity. Often prone to Inelegant Blubbering. May involve Get A Hold Of Yourself Woman to correct. Compare Screaming Woman and All Periods Are PMS (for when the character's reaction is dismissed as hormones acting up). Contrast Women Are Wiser (where women are depicted as more rational and emotionally stable than men) and Emotionless Girl.\nThis trope is a type of Strawman Emotional.",
