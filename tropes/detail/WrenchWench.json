    "description": "Mechanical inclinations have, for various reasons, traditionally been forte of men. The Wrench Wench is a girl who sets out to change all that. This can sometimes extend to pure electronic devices, but a Wrench Wench is more likely to be found with a blowtorch and ratchet set. She will always be confident about her own work, but because she's technically an enormous geek she sometimes has trouble with other things. She might also have Machine Empathy and can diagnose problems just by listening to the motor. She has been known to be Curious as a Monkey in the presence of new and interesting machines \u2014 or Constantly Curious, if inspection is impossible.\nUsually too self confident to ever need a Beautiful All Along plot, but very likely to have at least one She Cleans Up Nicely moment even though she's often an Unkempt Beauty anyway. Tick her off and a Wrench Whack may be in the offing.\nCan be used as a contrast to show that she's not as feminine as she first appears. She's often a Ms Fix It. Can also be The Blacksmith. When a Wrench Wench's talents go above and beyond the practical or realistic, she's also a Gadgeteer Genius. If it's computers and the Internet instead of mechanics, she's a Hackette. If her skills wax more technical than mechanical, chances are she's a Hot Scientist, though overlap can exist when dealing with things like mecha and androids which encompass both elements.\nThe Hood Ornament Hottie is a related trope, where the woman may be dressed or posed as if she was the mechanic, but actually is simply intended to be Eye-candy. A subtrope of The Engineer.\n\nExamples",
