    "description": "She's often cute, sometimes to the point of twee. She's affectionate, too but she also has a grip like a hydraulic press, and seems to want to be an article of clothing wrapped around the body of the guy she likes. Woe to him if he so much as looks at another girl (or if another girl looks at him), for she's usually armed with an Armor-Piercing Slap, a Megaton Punch or a Hyperspace Mallet, and she's willing to use it on him whether he invited the attention or not. She's the Clingy Jealous Girl, and she can be anywhere on the spectrum from a fondly-regarded nuisance to a psycho stalker.\nIf she's a Yandere, she'll snap and try to Murder the Hypotenuse at least once. Especially If I Can't Have You. If she's a Tsundere instead, her violence towards the male lead will be a Running Gag. If she has a Sugar and Ice Personality, she'll be more prone to snide comments and verbal violence than open clinginess. Depending on how possessive she is, their \"boyfriend's\" friends will also be targeted.\nExpect her to be the victim of lots of fan bashing for getting in between The Protagonist and his True Love, even if she actually loses. If she does manage to start a relationship with her object of affections, it will range anywhere from annoying gushing, All Take and No Give, or even Love Martyrdom.\nIn Fan Fiction, she is often what the Relationship Sue turns out to be in the end. Also, if a Mary Sue appears and snatches the love interest's attention away, the possible love rivals will become Clingy Jealous Girls to make her look better than she really is.\nHer Spear Counterpart is the Crazy Jealous Guy.\n\nExamples",
