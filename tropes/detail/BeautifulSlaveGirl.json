    "description": "Go-Go Enslavement and Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me both are based on the idea that enslaving a beautiful woman is exciting. It's about dominance and power being combined with sex which apparently turns some people on. To be strictly fair not all those people are male.\nA girl who is born a slave and then grows up to become beautiful is instead about the contrast between her beauty and her circumstances. \"A lily among the weeds,\" nevermind the Unfortunate Implications that other slaves are all weeds, beauty is a measure of a woman's worth, and that it's okay to enslave men and plain or ugly women.\nThis trope has an obvious dark side. Many of these girls are So Beautiful, It's a Curse, forced into wearing revealing clothing and often raped by their masters. Because of this, it's more likely to be the setup to a Rescue Romance. There is also more likely to be emphasis on the girl's purity as well, and the idea that goodness and beauty can be found anywhere, not just in prosperity.\nFar too common in Real Life throughout millennia wherever chattel slavery existed.\nOnly beautiful slave girls that are born slaves or enslaved before puberty should be listed as examples. Post-puberty examples can go into Made a Slave.",
