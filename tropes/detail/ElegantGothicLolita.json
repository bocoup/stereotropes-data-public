    "description": "The Elegant Gothic Lolita wears an outfit that makes her look like a Victorian doll: puffy skirts, lots of frills, bonnets, huge ribbons, mostly black. There's also shades of Alice in Wonderland (though it is beginning to fall out of favor), with the aforementioned dark motif. On occasion, her hair may be in Regal Ringlets or Ojou Ringlets.\nGothic lolita is actually a sub-style of the \"lolita\" subculture in Japan based on dressing in EGL as fashion, not costume. The specific Trope Namer is Mana, a Visual Kei artist, who uses \"Elegant Gothic Lolita\" to refer to his own brand of clothing, Moi-Meme-Moitie. So referring to lolita clothing as Elegant Gothic Lolita is like saying \"I'm going to play Nintendo\" when referring to video games. \"Gothic Lolita\" is also referred to as \"gothic and lolita\", \"GothLoli\" (gosurori), or \"loligoth.\" Western goth fashion is referred to as \"goth punk\" in Japan.\nKeep in mind that although creators might draw inspiration from lolita fashion or intend to show lolita outfits, they might not necessarily make accurate representations or real-life lolitas - who are almost always adults or teenagers dressing in the style for fashion and would be highly offended at any implication of encouraging or endorsing pedophilia.\nFor a general overview on the Lolita style of dress, as well as other styles, the Useful Notes page about Lolita Fashion has you covered.\nCan overlap with a Parasol of Prettiness, Fairytale Wedding Dress.\n\nExamples",
