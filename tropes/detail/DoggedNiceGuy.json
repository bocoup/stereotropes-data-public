    "description": "This is when Bob (this character is usually male, although female examples do exist) is madly in love with Alice. Alice doesn't seem too interested, so Bob keeps trying, hoping that she will change her mind.\nThis can play out in one of two ways:\n If Bob and Alice are strangers or distant acquaintances when he falls for her, after the first confession that was turned down, he will show his affection in more and more spectacular ways to prove his serious intentions. Sometimes, the people around them will expect that Bob will eventually get together with Alice. Once Bob's displays of affection convince Alice to change her mind about him and give him a chance, the two will be portrayed as a normal couple. This is frequently used by romantic comedies or other shows/movies where they want to keep the audience asking Will They or Won't They?\n If Bob and Alice are either long time friends, or strangers who just got into a Just Friends relationship, Bob will take a more low-key route. Bob will likely begin by saying that he has his hopes for a more serious relationship, and he hopes Alice will eventually feel the same. He's content to be Platonic Life Partners until that time comes. From here, he may remind her of his unrequited love every time he sees her, or he may never mention it again. Alice might refuse the Relationship Upgrade because she doesn't want to ruin this friendship, or else believe that Bob just has a schoolboy crush he'll get over. If Alice is in a relationship, Bob might try to accept it for Alice's sake. If Bob dates someone else in the interim, this may make Alice have a Green-Eyed Epiphany and create a Unrequited Love Switcheroo.\nIn traditional straight examples, as long as Bob is an honestly Nice Guy, or at least a decent guy, both of these two attitudes are usually expected to result in success. Due to the Rule of Romantic, Alice will always realize over time, that she really happens to love him back.\nIn some recent works, a more cynical, take on the trope might be used to point out some ways this type of thinking could backfire, resulting in a Deconstructed Character Archetype. Type 1 might irritate the object of their affection by treating them like a video game sidequest, where more gifts and displays of affection will equal more attraction. It can also have implications of a Stalker with a Crush situation, if Alice truly dislikes or fears Bob. And Type 2 might be portrayed either as a Manipulative Bastard, for whom the whole long-term friendship is just a means to an end, or tragically mistaken for not recognizing that Alice still only feels like they're Like Brother and Sister and reacts with extreme Squick to romantic gestures. And both Type 1 and Type 2 might be examined to show that Bob actually feels that he's Entitled to Have You and thinks that, since he's a \"nice guy\" who is interested in Alice, Alice is morally obligated to date him.\nThis recent shift to more harsh portrayals is in part due to the usual cycle of tropes and part to media trying to avert the the implications that Men Act, Women Are, and that a romantic resolution depends solely on the man's determination.\nGender Inverted variations often occur, typically with a natural-looking, down-to-earth woman who is determined to win over the male friend she secretly loves, hoping he will eventually learn to appreciate her wholesome charms (often contrasted to the flashier appeal of a high-maintenance, unworthy gold-digger). For example in the Harem Genre, girls often recognize each other as \"rivals\", and treat the whole situation as a race where the most determined girl \"wins\" the protagonist's heart. Also, more traditional romantic stories, written by either men or women, might give a woman the same behavior, suggesting that these writers (and their audiences) find something inherently romantic about that kind of dogged determination, even without the Unfortunate Implications of a gender's inherent domination.\nSee also Extraverted Nerd, Just Friends, I Want My Beloved to Be Happy, Nice Guy, and Romantic Runner-Up. This heavily relies on the Hard Work Fallacy.\nCompare with the less sympathetic Stalker with a Crush, Mad Love, and Abhorrent Admirer.\nContrast Cannot Spit It Out, where the person is incapable of expressing their romantic interest even once, let alone over and over again.\nPlease keep the Real Life examples limited to those that examine the Dogged Nice Guy as a trope.\n\nExamples",
