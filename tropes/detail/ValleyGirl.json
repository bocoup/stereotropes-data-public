    "description": "Oh my God! I am like \u2014 so totally glad to see you!\nExcept you. Put some pants on, already! Gross!\nLike, anyway, I'm what some of you, like, call a \"Stalk Parody Character\", and yes, there are some totally creepy guys who\u2014\nOh, \"Stock Parody Character\"! I am SOOOOOO completely embarrassed! I gotta watch out for homophobes. Wait, that's, like, something else.\nSo if you want to, like, put someone like me in a story, you need these four totally important traits. Leave one out, and you just have some cheap knockoff of me, and that would just be, like, so tacky. Oh my God.\n The way I talk is, like, way important. Aside from my fabulous clothes, it's the easiest way to tell it's my hot self. You can do, like, degrees of it, but if I don't hear a hint of it, you're not truly from The Valley. Go, like, screw yourself, impostor!\n I am so fashion conscious, everybody. See what I'm wearing? Does any of it, like, clash? I don't think so! Unlike those skanky bitches on Sex and the City, I don't throw on just anything I feel like. A dress isn't like a car. You can't just, like, turn the key and drive off. It's like the space shuttle, or something. Everything has to be, you know, totally perfect before takeoff.\n Some people say I'm dumb, and I say those people are fat. But I just, like, don't have room in my head for too much. I mean, The American Revolution was what, like, a hundred years ago? All the available Revlon lipstick colors are around right now. I think we all know which is more important.\n ...right? Yeah, 4. Being rich, is like, totally awesome, but you just need a good credit card. And if there isn't a mall to hang out, there should be some good stores around to shop in. If there isn't either, you totally have my sympathies. Heck, give my friends and me a call. We'll help you move. I am so dead serious. Towns like that are for, like, no one.\nOkay, even though I'm best known for being from California, I can be, like, global, or something. The Valley isn't like, just in the Valley. Oh my God, was that like, totally deep or something?\nOh, and I totally know that I'm, like, not a real person in real life, or anything. I'm some kind of stereotype, you know, like parroting teens in The Eighties and The Nineties, or some junk. Sometimes people like to use me as like, an example for like, how kids don't know how to, you know, speak well, or something? And I'm also, like, intertwined with the Dumb Blonde troop now, I mean trope. And I don't care what what Mitzy Connor said, this is NOT a dye job! Puhleez!\nAnyway, compare Totally Radical, The Ditz, Surfer Dude (who's, like, totally hot, could you just die?), Brainless Beauty, Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense.\nAlso, totally not related to that Uncanny Valley Girl. She's, like, soooooo weird. For sure!",
