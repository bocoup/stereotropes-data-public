    "description": "She is beautiful. She is sweet. She is sincere. So why can't she get the guy already? The Unrequited Tragic Maiden is (usually) a female character that seems to have all the perfect characteristics to make her the ideal romantic interest or even The Ingenue of the story, but alas, for some reason the object of her affections does not view her as such. Usually this is because she is overshadowed by another female character who has captivated the heart of the guy, placing the Unrequited Tragic Maiden on the sideline only to be seen as a friend or ward.\nNo matter how painful her yearning for love is, the Unrequited Tragic Maiden never truly achieves her happily ever after with the one she loves. She endures it all with a sad smile and is often reduced to a tragic fate. She is the poster child of Unrequited Love. In the end she will often sacrifice herself or her happiness to make sure her beloved is happy.\nFan reactions to her tend to be mixed. Many fans will cheer and push for the Maiden's success, to the extent of calling The Hero an Ungrateful Bastard if he doesn't fall to the girl's feet (because the often never asked for pining and sacrifices are seen by fans as him owing her affection or sex no matter what he actually thinks or says) or Slut Shaming any possible female love rival (because The Hero is seen as a tool of women's validation and some think that women shouldn't act on their own romantic feelings if it interferes with others); and if the Maiden doesn't succeed, much bashing of the author shall be expected. On the other hand, others will turn against the Maiden and call her insulting names; this is especially obvious if either The Hero has another prospect love interest or female friend who's perceived as being \"stronger\" and \"cooler\" than the maiden herself, or the Maiden has a second prospect male love interest whose (canon or not) feelings she passes up on to favor The Hero.\n(It should also be pointed out that, specially in modern times, several of these Maidens are also full-blooded characters with motivations, relationships, backstories and/or interests that go beyond their Unrequited Loves... and yet many fans will insist on only focusing on their love woes, either ignoring or refusing to see their non-romantic character depths.)\nCompare to Hopeless Suitor and Romantic Runner-Up, who is the brother of this trope but usually with a less tragic end. May wind up becoming The Lost Lenore after death if the person they loved grieves for them, blames themselves for her death or else only discovers that he loved her when it was too late. Contrast to Green-Eyed Monster, in which the woman is more prone to sabotage and a devious nature unlike the docile nature of the Unrequited Tragic Maiden.\nThis is starting to become either a Discredited Trope as romantic portrayals of females become less dependent on the male characters, or a Deconstructed Trope to showcase a point-of-view of it being an unrealistic idea of romantic love.",
