    "description": "The Distaff Counterpart to Badass Baritone: If a female character's voice is noticeably lower than those of other women in the work, it's a sure sign that she is a lot more dangerous than they. As such, contralto voices are usually reserved for tough Action Girls and Femme Fatales.\nSome female characters, in the meantime, may go from a higher-pitched voice to a menacing contralto when they're about to kick someone's ass, or during changes of their persona when the character gets serious. A common reason for a change in persona is for the character to tap into some mystical power. Being taken over by her Super-Powered Evil Side could be another reason for this since Evil Sounds Deep. Or maybe she just gets in the zone during Let's Get Dangerous moments and the deep voice is reflecting that.\nCompare and contrast Badass Baritone, and Women Are Delicate, at least when it comes to a \"feminine\" vs. \"masculine\" voice. May overlap with Alto Villainess and Evil Sounds Deep.",
