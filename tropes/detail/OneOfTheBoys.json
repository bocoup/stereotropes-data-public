    "description": "Some girls pal around with male friends instead of having girl friends. They play male games (baseball instead of softball), and might even become accepted as just one of the boys. She might be rude, and use crude, or less refined slang like a boy. She spits, bleeds, and plays in the dirt, without caring about getting dirty. She'd never say something like \"I Broke a Nail\".\nWhen introduced, she might proceed to beat the crap out of the biggest boy (who probably made some comment about how girls are too weak or girly to play with) to make sure everyone understands that she's one of the boys and not expecting any special treatment. Of course, because of the Double Standard and Wouldn't Hit a Girl restraints she usually is treated differently, but not as much as other girls.\nUsually a Tomboy, and often subject to a She Cleans Up Nicely in a Beautiful All Along plot, but unlike other girls she protests and is upset about the event, considering herself a victim as being forced to wear a dress is humiliating, and she probably looks pretty nice already. Not to mention it undermines all the work she put into getting the boys to accept her as one of them. Often following such an event she has to beat one of the boys up all over again.\nIn a strange twist, Chickification is often seen as an improvement for this character. The boys she hangs with often find the development of feminine attributes in their best friend a positive development as they now have an approachable girl who also has a lot in common them. Other times her Tomboyish ways backfire on her when her friends who are boys get to a dating age, and all come to her expecting advice on how to court their latest crush. She might feel left out by this development. Other times one of her friends will be unable to find a date for the dance, and suddenly turn to her and say: \"Hey! You're a girl!\" and suggest she become his date for the night \u2014 just to help out a pal of course, it doesn't mean anything. She might not be happy about this. On the other hand, this sort of girl might grow up to be The Lad-ette.\nAn Action Girl is sometimes portrayed as being someone who is still \"one of the guys\" at age 15-30. Possibly a form of subtle Fanservice (or not so subtle, depending on the character).\nSometimes a Wholesome Crossdresser, which might cause a Sweet on Polly Oliver situation. Often a Redhead. Might have been Raised by Dudes.\n\nExamples",
