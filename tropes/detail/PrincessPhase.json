    "description": "If you ask a girl who's in preschool or kindergarten she'll probably know that Everything's Better with Princesses. She will have a fairy tale princess's attitude making her anywhere between a gracious but breakable cutie and a Tiny Tyrannical Girl who might feel entitled to a pony. Bonus points if she is a fan of the Disney Princesses.\nShe is or acts like she's seven years old at the most. Princesses Prefer Pink so that's probably her favorite color. She'll imagine herself as a pretty princess or pretend to be a princess bride. Her court will be consist of stuffed animals and dolls. She might want a Prince Charming by her side as long as she still gets to be her Daddy's Girl, looking up to him as if he's a king. If you tried to explain it to her she wouldn't understand why Girls Need Role Models. To emphasize this concept she might have a Sweet Tooth because Real Men Hate Sugar.\nIf early childhood isn't specifically mentioned it might fall under Princess for a Day or Everything's Better with Princesses.\nThis trope is so strongly associated with childhood that a teenage or adult woman still clinging to this attitude cannot but come across as childish. Still, even those who grow out of it will still cling to a wistful shred or two: a taste for romance and a Prince Charming, or a pretty gown they twirl around in when no one is watching. The wedding industry in particular is built around letting women be a \"princess\" for a day.\nCompare Real Men Wear Pink (where there's a little princess in each manly man), Pink Means Feminine, Graceful Ladies Like Purple.\nContrast One of the Boys.",
